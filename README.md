# Channel Pizza Web App Challenge

* In this challenge we ask you to make an simple full-stack application for a pizza delivery service where users can look through pizza types and make an order.

* Users can also login and application require login in order to make an order. You can ignore payment module.

* When user entering address information front-end should autocomplete the addresses using UK post code with [PostCodes API](https://postcodes.io/).

* User interface and software architecture of the application is up to you, for technology stack of the application you are free to use any framework and language for backend, frontend and database but we **_highly_** recommend you to use **Java Spring Boot** for backend, **Vue.js** for frontend and **MongoDB** for database.

* We expect the code is production ready so that the code should include **JavaDoc**, **JSDoc**, *Unit Testing* and *Integration Testing* with **JUnit** and **mockito** also **Vue.js** unit testing.

* Building tools like **Maven** or **Gradle** is required, we suggest you to use *Gradle*.

* In order to the application work on any environment it should be containerized, to accomplish that the projects should include **Dockerfile** for each service and application needs to run on a *Docker* container.

* The code should include **Git** version control system so that other members of the team review and use the code.

* You should start this challenge by cloning this repository then creating different branch and when the code is ready you can make _pull request_ to this repository so that it can be reviewed.

Thank you and good luck
